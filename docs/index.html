                I achieved a record time of 80 seconds and received an Excellence Award at an AI object recognition-based solar tracking robot competition.
                The goal of the competition was to complete the given task as quickly as possible without crossing the boundary lines while following a designated path.
                I focused on the efficient integration of hardware and software, developing a driving algorithm based on the amount of light.
                This approach allowed me to solve the problem of the robot occasionally crossing the boundary lines.
